1. Introduction

1.1 Purpose of this document

Overview of this project along with functionalities,intended users ,user interface and software
requirements.

1.2 Overview

Supermarket management system is the system where all the aspects related to the proper
management of supermarkets are done. These aspects involve managing information about
the various products, staff, managers, customers, billing etc. This system provides an efficient
way of managing the supermarket information. Also allows the customer to purchase and pay
for the items purchased.

This project is based on the sales transaction and billing of items in a supermarket. The first
activity is based on adding the items to the system along with the rate which are present in the
supermarket and the name of the items which the supermarket will agree to sell. This
authority is given only to the product manager. Any modifications to be done in the item
name and the rate can be done only by him. He also has the right to delete any item. As the
customer buys the products and comes to the billing counter, the user is supposed to enter the
item name he purchased and the quantity of the item he had purchased.

This study is to produce software which manages the sales activity done in a supermarket,
maintaining the stock details, maintaining the records of the sales done for a particular
month/year,managing employees working for the store etc. The users will consume less time
in calculation and the sales activity will be completed within a fraction of seconds whereas
manual system will make the user to write it down which is a long procedure and so
paperwork will be reduced and the user can spend more time on monitoring the supermarket.
The project will be user friendly and easy to use.
